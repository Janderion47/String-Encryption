# String-Encryption
*Encoding strings of letters to numbers,
 and decoding them back to letters.*

There are multiple variations on the encoder.
Each have different math in their encryption.
Both the encoders and decoders of all of the levels have different
 inputs, which all have an effect on the out put of the code.
Make sure the inputs are the same on both the encoders and decoders
 for the correct results.

This code has not been designed to return any information;
it has been designed to be used in the python interpreter or an IDE.

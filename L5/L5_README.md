The format of the L5 encoder and decoder is a little different.

For each variable "a, b & c",
there are three inputs within square brackets.
For example, L5_Encoder(1, \[2, 3, 4], \[5, 6, 7], \[8, 9, 10]).
This input information has to be perfectly the same with the decoder.
An example on how the L5 code functions is in the "TEST.py" file.

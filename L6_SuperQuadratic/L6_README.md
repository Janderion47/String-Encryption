The L6 Encoder and Decoder are very similar, but also different.

Each variable "a, b & c" require three inputs in brackets; \[1, 2, 3].
Number 1 of each variable defines the normal "a, b, c" as in L1 to L4.
Number 2 defines how much each variable will change with each step.
The step variable defines how many times the data will be fed through
the math equation in the "do_over" function; the default is 5 steps.

**Warning:** With increasingly larger inputs and longer inputted scripts to
encrypt, the system running the program will need more time to process
all of the data.
